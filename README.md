Powershell modular framework for doing live forensic acquisitions in Windows environments.  

This is a work in progress to create a modular framework that you can easily add new functions while keeping the script mostly self-contained and easy to run with minimal impact on the Windows host. Currently tested backward compatible to Powershell version 2.

Not all functions are 100% tested, but exist to show potential capabilities or spark additional ideas.

Thanks for your interest!
